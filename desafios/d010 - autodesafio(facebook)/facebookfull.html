                            Launched initially as <strong>FaceMash</strong> in October 2003, Facebook was founded by Mark Zuckerberg, Eduardo Saverin, Dustin Moskovitz, Chris Hughes, and Andrew McCollum. This social networking platform supports messaging, media upload, voice, and video calls, etc. FaceMash was changed to TheFacebook in 2004.

                            When first launched, only <strong>Harvard University</strong> students were eligible members of the social network. However, with time, membership was extended across the <strong>Ivy League, Boston Area</strong>, and other universities in the Canada and US. By September 2006, you can register on Facebook if you have a valid email and are at least 13 years old.

                            The Founding of Facebook: How It Happened
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Zuckerberg</strong> decided to create a student directory with photos and basic personal information,  <strong>Facemash</strong>, which used photos compiled from the online facebooks of nine dormitory Houses, placing two next to each other and asking users to choose the hotter person. To accomplish this, Mark hacked into the protected areas of Harvard's computer network and copied the houses' private dormitory ID images.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Harvard at that time did not have a student directory with photos and essential information, and the <strong>Facemash</strong> site generated 450 visitors and 22000 photo-views in its first several hours online. The initial site mirrored people's physical community—with their real identities, represented the key aspects of what later became Facebook.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The site was quickly forwarded to several campus group list servers but was shut down a few days later by the Harvard administration. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/24/19-year-old-mark-zuckerberg-on-privacy-issues-versus-today.html" target="_blank" style="color: #f8ae25;">Zuckerberg got into trouble, being charged by the administration with breach of security, violating copyrights, and violating individual privacy, and faced expulsion</a>, but ultimately the charges were dropped.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The following semester, in January 2004, Mark began writing code for a new website. In February 2004, he launched the <strong>Thefacebook</strong> site, initially located at URL <strong>thefacebook.com</strong>. When Zuckerberg finished the site, he told a couple of friends, and one of them put it on an online mailing list. Immediately several dozen people joined, and then they were telling people at the other houses. It was like an avalanche; within twenty-four hours, <strong>Thefacebook</strong> had somewhere between twelve hundred and fifteen hundred registrants.

                            Initially, membership was restricted to students of <strong>Harvard College</strong>, and within the first month, more than half the undergraduate population at Harvard was registered on the site. Mark soon attracted assistants to promote the website—<strong>Eduardo Saverin</strong> (business aspects), <strong>Dustin Moskovitz</strong> (programmer), <strong>Andrew McCollum</strong> (graphic artist), and <strong>Chris Hughes</strong>. In March 2004, Facebook expanded to 3 other Universities—Stanford, Columbia, and Yale. This expansion continued when it opened to all Ivy League and Boston area schools, and gradually most universities in Canada and the United States.

                            The company Facebook incorporated in the summer of 2004 and the entrepreneur <strong>Sean Parker</strong>, who had been informally advising Zuckerberg, became the company's president. At the same time, the company received its first investment of US$500000 from PayPal co-founder <a href="https://history-computer.com/peter-thiel-complete-biography/" target="_blank" style="color:#f8ae25;">Peter Thiel</a> and moved its base of operations to Palo Alto, California. The company dropped The from its name after purchasing the domain name facebook.com in 2005 for $200000.

                            Facebook started in 2003 as a student directory featuring basic information and photos proposed to replace the domineering paper sheets and private online directories used at Harvard. Facebook was originally called FaceMash when launched in 2003.

                            Although, when created, membership was restricted to only Harvard University students; however, by March 2004, membership had expanded to almost all universities in Canada and the United States.

                        <p>
                            Facebook dropped the “The” suffix in 2005 after the domain name, Facebook.com was purchased. During this same period, Facebook headquarters was moved to Palo Alto, California, and Sean Parker, Zuckerberg's unofficial advisor, was appointed as the company's president.

                            After hitting the six millionth registrants in December 2005, the network further expanded to universities in the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Australia, and several other parts of the world that could now register. Also, employees of top companies, such as Microsoft and Apple, became eligible to register. The social media platform became available to everyone 13 years and older in September 2006, and with this, the social media network users skyrocketed to several million.

                            The company introduced the group pages feature in 2007, allowing companies to attract prospects and close multiple deals without leaving the website. Over 100,000 business pages were registered in the beta testing stage.
